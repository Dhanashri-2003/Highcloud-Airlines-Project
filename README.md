# ✈️ HighCloud Airlines – Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This is my **second end-to-end data analytics project**, focused on analyzing **HighCloud Airlines' operational and sales performance** using **SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**.

The goal of this project is to derive **business-ready insights** around **load factor, route performance, capacity utilization, passenger trends, and revenue patterns**, and present them in a way that supports **strategic decision-making**.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

* Asking the **right business questions**
* Performing **structured SQL analysis**
* Validating data using **Excel**
* Building **interactive dashboards** in Power BI & Tableau
* Communicating insights clearly through presentations

---

## 🧠 Business Problem Statements

* Which routes are **underperforming despite high capacity**?
* How does **Load Factor** vary by **route, aircraft, and time**?
* Are there **seasonal or yearly trends** in passenger demand?
* Which routes contribute the **most and least** to overall utilization?
* Where should the airline **optimize capacity or pricing**?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **SQL (MySQL)** – Data cleaning, transformation & KPI calculations
* **Excel** – Data validation, pivot analysis & cross-checking
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards & KPI tracking
* **Tableau** – Tableau – Data visualization & trend analysis
* **PowerPoint** – for presentating the insights

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed

* **Load Factor (%)**
* **Total Available Seats vs Transported Passengers**
* **Route-wise & City-pair Performance**
* **Year-over-Year (YoY) Trends**
* **Underperforming Routes (High Capacity, Low Utilization)**
* **Running Totals & Contribution Analysis**

## 🔍 Sample SQL Insights

* Identified **routes with load factor below 60% despite high seat capacity**
* Calculated **overall and route-level load factor** using conditional logic
* Used **window functions** for running totals and trend analysis
* Performed **aggregation & ranking** to highlight top and bottom routes

---

## 📌 Key Business Insights

* Several high-capacity routes consistently operate at **low load factors**, indicating poor demand forecasting
* Passenger demand shows **seasonal fluctuations**, suggesting pricing and scheduling optimization opportunities
* A small set of routes contribute **disproportionately to overall utilization**
* Opportunity exists to **reallocate capacity** from low-performing routes to high-demand ones

---


## 🚀 Next Improvements (Future Scope)

* Forecast passenger demand using time-series models
* Add profitability analysis (Revenue vs Cost)
* Automate data refresh using SQL → BI pipelines
* Include pricing elasticity analysis
